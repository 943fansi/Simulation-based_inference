## Simulation-based inference
> **Simulation-based inference** is a cutting-edge statistical approach that employs computer simulations to estimate parameters within intricate probabilistic models. It is particularly advantageous in scenarios where traditional methods struggle due to the complexity of the system or the absence of analytical solutions. Rather than relying on conventional techniques based on closed-form solutions or known probability density functions, simulation-based inference utilizes repeated Monte Carlo simulations to construct the posterior distribution of parameters, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty ranges.

> However, **simulation-based inference** is distinct from traditional Bayesian inference in its application. While both methods aim to estimate posterior distributions of model parameters, simulation-based inference is specifically tailored for situations where conventional Bayesian approaches face obstacles, particularly in handling highly intricate models where direct application of Bayes' theorem is unfeasible. Furthermore, it should be noted that simulation-based inference diverges from frequentist inference, which typically relies on the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for inference purposes.-
